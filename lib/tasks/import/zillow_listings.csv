8 Deals - $800
10 Deals - $1000
(Calculated by closed deals at the end of the month)

****Special bonus units count as 2 deals!
These are calculated at the end of the month, not stacked. Meaning 6 deals pays $400 at the end of the month NOT $600. I want to make sure the managers explain this correctly so the person with 8 deals isn&#39;t expecting $1400 (they get $800)

The first is an exterior entrance key for the garden level.  The second is an entrance key for the basement door to the garden apartment.  When showing, my strong preference is that once you and your customer enter the building, only you go down to the basement as the staircase leading down to the basement is steep.  Key yourself into the apartment and then come up from the interior staircase and unlock the door for your customer.  Also, it&#39;s imperative that all doors, including the terrace door be LOCKED and that all windows be shut and locked after each appointment.  Earlier today, the building door, unit door, garden door and basement door were all unlocked when I arrived at the building.  Please return the keys to the lockbox after each appointment.
